## Troubleshooting

### "No devices found" error during setup

This error means authentication succeeded, but the Navien cloud API returned an empty device list. To resolve:

1. **Verify device in NaviLink app**: 
   - Open the NaviLink Smart Control mobile app
   - Ensure your NWP500 device appears in the app
   - Verify you can control the device from the app

2. **Check device online status**:
   - Ensure the device is powered on
   - Verify WiFi connection is active on the device
   - Check the device's WiFi indicator light

3. **Re-register device if necessary**:
   - In the NaviLink app, try removing and re-adding the device
   - Follow the device setup wizard in the app
   - Wait a few minutes for registration to complete

4. **Verify account credentials**:
   - Ensure you're using the correct Navien account
   - If you have multiple accounts, verify which one has the device registered
   - Try logging out and back into the NaviLink app

5. **Check for multiple users**:
   - Only the account that registered the device may see it in the API
   - Contact the device owner if you're using a shared device

### Integration won't load

- Ensure all dependencies are properly installed
- Check Home Assistant logs for specific errors
- Restart Home Assistant

### No device status updates
