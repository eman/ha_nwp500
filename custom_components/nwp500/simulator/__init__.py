"""The hot water simulator: nwp500-python's `nwp500.sim`, for each heater.

The simulator is optional. This package is imported only when it is
switched on, and then in Home Assistant's import executor: it imports the
library's simulator, and with it numpy and pandas, at module level so
nothing heavy is imported later in the event loop.

For each heater a runner keeps a 24-hour simulation up to date from the
heater's reports (`runner.py`); the entities read its answer
(`sensor.py`); the `nwp500.simulate` service walks a scenario on request
(`service.py`).
